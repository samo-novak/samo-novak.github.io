# Research

I am a PhD student in the project-team [COSMIQ](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/) at Inria, under the supervision of [Anthony Leverrier](https://sites.google.com/site/anthonyleverrier/) and [Christophe Vuillot](https://members.loria.fr/CVuillot/), since November 2024.

The topic of my research is quantum error correction, especially the construction of error correcting codes and the search for fault-tolerance. I focus on homological rotor codes: in short, codes that can be defined by chain complexes of $\mathbb{Z}$-modules (cf. $\mathbb{F}_2$-vector spaces of usual error correction) and similar construction. You can find out more [here](research).


Previously, I worked also on classical simulation of quantum optics, see more [here](research#classical-simulation).
