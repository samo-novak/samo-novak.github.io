- **Quantum error correction with rotors and torsion**.  
  *Journ√©es C2, April 2025, Pornichet.* [\[Slides\]](/assets/files/journees-c2-2025.pdf)  
  I introduced my ongoing research on quantum codes constructed with **rotors**, specifically focusing on the fact that this leads to **torsion**, including examples of where the latter may come from.

- **What is a rotor, and why is it $\mathbb{Z}$?**  
  *Workshop of NISQ2LSQ, January 2025, Marseille.* [Blackboard talk]
