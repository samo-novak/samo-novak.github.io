- **Quantum error correction with rotors and torsion**.  
  *[Journ√©es C2](https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/11948/), April 2025, Pornichet.* [\[Slides\]](/assets/files/journees-c2-2025.pdf)  
  I introduced my ongoing research on quantum codes constructed with **rotors**, specifically focusing on the fact that this leads to **torsion**, including examples of where the latter may come from.

- **What is a rotor, and why is it $\mathbb{Z}$?**  
  *Workshop of [NISQ2LSQ](https://project.inria.fr/nisq2lsq/), January 2025, Marseille.* [Blackboard talk]
